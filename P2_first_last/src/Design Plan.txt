Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

After reading the specs start populating
a list of things you think you might have to
do to finish this project

To do:
	- understand what the spec is asking
	- understand map-based input files
	- create stack and queue methods
	- instance variables, probably includes a 2d array (maze)
	- getters and setters
	- probably need a scanner to scan a doc to get maze
	- create a constructor that takes in the items from scanner
	- file reading, make tiles for each element and put them in map array
	- method to get the runtime of the code
